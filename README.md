# CPP Module 08

## Overview

This project is part of the C++ modules at Ecole 42. It focuses on advanced C++ concepts such as templates, containers, iterators, and algorithm implementation. The module is divided into several exercises, each designed to deepen your understanding of modern C++ programming.

## Structure

- **ex00/**: Introduction to template functions and algorithms.
- **ex01/**: Implementation and manipulation of custom container classes.
- **ex02/**: Advanced usage of templates and iterators with stack-like containers.

Each exercise contains its own `Makefile` and `src/` directory with the relevant source files.

## How to Build

Navigate to the exercise directory and run:

```sh
make
```

This will compile the sources and generate the corresponding executable.

## How to Run

After building, run the executable generated in the exercise directory:

```sh
./<executable_name>
```

Replace `<executable_name>` with the actual name produced by the Makefile.

## Project Goals

- Practice and master C++ templates and STL containers
- Implement custom algorithms and container classes
- Understand and use iterators effectively
- Write clean, modular, and efficient C++ code

## Requirements

- No external libraries unless specified

## Author

This project is completed as part of the Ecole 42 curriculum.
